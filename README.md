# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Building an APK with EAS

This project is configured to use [EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/) for creating Android APK files.

### Prerequisites

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Log in to your Expo account:
   ```bash
   npx eas login
   ```
   If you don't have an Expo account, you can create one at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev/signup).

### Building an APK

To build an APK for testing:

```bash
npm run build:androidapk
```

This will:
1. Start the EAS build process
2. Build an APK file in the cloud
3. Provide a download link when the build is complete

### Other Build Options

- For internal testing (faster builds):
  ```bash
  npm run build:android
  ```

- For production release:
  ```bash
  npm run build:production
  ```
